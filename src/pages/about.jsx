                Hello there, welcome to my website! My name is James Reaver,
                just like the character of the Fable video game series. I am a
                British-Italian software engineer with a passion for
                customer-focussed services.
              </p>
              <p>
                After finishing school, I moved from Cardiff to London, where I
                studied for a Master of Engineering in Computer Science at
                Imperial College. Dreaming of working for the British
                Government, my career kicked off as a full-stack developer at
                the Prime Minister’s Office. There, I found out that I wanted
                to dive deeper into the field of software engineering, and so, I
                moved to Amazon and finally to JP.Morgan.
              </p>
              <p>
                While I am quite fond of writing code and discussing software
                architecture at work, I also like to let my imagination free and
                write fictional stories. Three years ago, I began putting
                together a narrative for a theatre play, which I am currently in
                the process of completing. Aside from that, I also really enjoy
                recording audiobooks and radio shows, where I broadcast the
                latest hits of the music charts.
              </p>
              <p>
                I keep this site up to date as often as I can. A lot is still
                missing, and a lot more is yet to come. Do not hesitate to drop
                me a message if you want to know more about what’s coming.
