How are you doing today?<br></strong>Hey there! Great it\u2019s a pleasure to be\u00a0here.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for wanting to answer a few questions about your newly released work. Before we get into the details of the book itself, could you tell us: who is James Reaver?<br></strong>I thank <em>you</em> for your time. Sure\u2026 James Reaver is many things. My career and I would say that I am a software developer. I\u2019ve enjoyed tinkering with my computer since I received one. And soon after my home got connected to the Internet (around the age of twelve I reckon), I set up the \u2018Magic Diamond Forum\u2019, a role-playing Harry Potter community where people could sign up, attend lessons and practice spells. Currently I work on far less wondrous projects as a full-time software engineer. And I enjoy writing code\u2026 a lot, but while that takes up a good chunk of my logical skills, I also like to let my imagination free and write fictional stories every time I get the chance. That\u2019s where my path as a writer and playwright began. Mr Reaver has always been a creative geek at\u00a0heart.</p>\n<p><strong>What has your writing experience been prior to this new play?</strong><br>I\u2019ve meddled with several stories in the past, though none of them materialised into a complete manuscript. One of them was set in an alternative past, where England had won the Hundred Years\u2019 War and taken over large parts of France, thus reigning over both countries from Versailles. A prince of the Tudor dynasty takes to the New World on an adventure but gets captured by an Arawak tribe. It\u2019s a 15 year old idea so I do not recall much more than that. A story which instead made it out of my teenage years is that of <a href=\"https://www.reaver.me/books/russel-toucan\">Russel Toucan</a>. It\u2019s a children\u2019s novel I wrote while in school. Having dug it up recently, I was able to re-edit it and publish it anew. I would consider that to be my first\u00a0book.</p>\n<p><strong>Now we come to your most recent work, \u2018The Hero of Mistpeak\u2019. I\u2019m curious to know how this play came together. How did the idea came to you and what was the process that went on behind the writing?<br></strong>I had been having a few ideas about a plot line which involved the characters of my favourite video game series\u200a\u2014\u200aFable\u200a\u2014\u200asince finishing university. It was only during the first lockdown of 2020 that I began stringing those pieces together: every night I would lie in my bed and mentally \u201cweave\u201d new parts of the story, until it became too complicated to rely on my memory. I started writing it down, and I was very methodical about it. First of all, I wanted to plan out the <em>whole</em> story before jotting down even a single line of it. I wanted to know exactly how it would have ended, to make sure I could lay out the correct foundations since its inception. I studied every character carefully, and allowed them to develop their own goals and thoughts based on the informations they possessed at each moment of the story. This process took just under two years. Only at that point, I began to flesh out Part One, scene by scene, line by line. I then revised it several times until it was\u00a0ready.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hrk0g8B24wXQrBJIPUp_EA.jpeg\"></figure><p><strong>It was ready and now it\u2019s out for free on </strong><a href=\"https://books.apple.com/book/id6504457644\"><strong>Apple Books</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IL8OEQAAQBAJ\"><strong>Google Play</strong></a><strong>! You spent a lot of time developing the story. What is it about?<br></strong>The Hero of Mistpeak continues the story as it ends with Fable III. The Industrial Revolution is taking its toll on the people of Albion: prejudice, hatred and unrest are spreading. When a royal wedding is announced between Elliot, the Prince of Albion, and the son of the foreign King of Samarkand, the people of Albion decide to rebel. The very Elliot objects to the union, as he finds himself in love with a mysterious girl he met on a mission to Aurora. Meanwhile, unscrupulous business owner Reaver is on a quest for something which will spark a heinous war amongst all nations. The plot lines are several, and they all interweave in a series of feuds and double-crosses. Some of the themes are the usual ones: fiery romances, unrequited love and journeys to distant lands, while others are more complex and relevant to this day: nationalism, xenophobia and intolerance. The shrewdest might even spot some similarities with the current Royal Family, all dressed with the same gloop of British humour which has made the Fable series so appreciated and\u00a0beloved.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of Fable, I find two aspects of this book particularly striking: that it is set in the universe of this video game series, and that it is not written as a novel, but rather a theatre play. Why these choices?<br></strong>Fable is not only my favourite video game series, it\u2019s also one of the first I have ever played. I am by no means a huge gamer, however the world of Albion immediately struck a chord: it\u2019s immersive, it\u2019s irreverent, it\u2019s full of character and unequivocally British. It\u2019s beautifully within the fantasy genre, never too supernatural, or too gory or too plain. I believe I could not have picked a better universe in which to set my play. Yes, it as a stage play because no other means of writing would have allowed me to make the characters the very fulcrum of the story the way plays do. With such richness of individualities, desires, goals, trains of thoughts, a play just is the right way to convey it all to the audience. I wrote an article about \u2018<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jameshreaver/the-beauty-of-a-play-e223fee4ae5a\">The Beauty of a Play</a>\u2019, if you want to read more about\u00a0it.</p>\n<p><strong>Very quickly, what was the most pleasant part to write? Which was the most challenging?<br></strong>Good question. I enjoyed writing the characters of Ben Finn, the cheeky and libertine Captain of the Guard, and of Reaver, the hated and exploitative owner of all of Bowerstone\u2019s factories. Both characters have such strong personalities, and due to their standing, they have the benefit of speaking their mind fully and unreservedly. That is a playwright\u2019s dream. The most challenging part was the first scene. In general, every story\u2019s beginning is the hardest to get right, however this play\u2019s was particularly difficult as I had to reveal just the right level of information to capture the audience, while ensuring I wasn\u2019t giving too much away. You see, the narration begins <em>in medias res</em> with a royal funeral and<em> </em>it is full of poignancy and pathos. Coincidentally, I had begun drafting it the very week of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral. It was quite a\u00a0moment.</p>\n<p><strong>We\u2019re drawing towards the end, so I am curious: what is coming next? What are you working on at the present?</strong><br>I am determined to publish Part Two of \u2018The Hero of Mistpeak\u2019. Having already planned the whole story, I know I have to finish it. In fact, as I work on it, I am starting to realise that a Part Three might be necessary to fully close the story. But that one might need to wait as I have more ideas in store. I would like to move back to novels, for adults this time. And only after my next trip to Italy. That\u2019s all I can\u00a0say.</p>\n<p><strong>I understand\u2026 I look forward to the next act of \u2018The Hero of Mistpeak\u2019. Thank you so much for your time today!</strong><br>So do I\u2026 It was a pleasure!</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=0ff2c2865d3c\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h4>An interview with author James H.

Authors of theatrical pieces simply need be a bit more creative about it. For example, narrators can exist in plays, and they do. Sometimes, the most crucial parts of the plot are not only spoken, but they are even sung. Characters may speak out their<strong> inner thoughts</strong> just as freely as they would in books.

Because so little about a scene might be narrated by the author, readers of a play have a chance to experience a play in a way that is without equal. All the scenery-building, character-painting, action-unfolding and tone-setting work\u200a\u2014\u200awhich would normally be carried out by several production teams\u200a\u2014\u200awill be up to\u00a0them.</p>\n<h4>Here lies the challenge, and the\u00a0reward.</h4>\n<p>As you, the reader, make your way through the acts of a play, scene after scene, you will have the arduous task of interpretation and portrayal of all roles and events.

Sure, novels get turned into films\u200a\u2014\u200aand spectacular ones at that\u200a\u2014\u200abut these very rarely match their printed sources the way plays do when\u00a0staged.</p>\n<p>I will not blame you if all of this sounds pretty laborious: it might well be at first.

Or you might find out their names way ahead of any such information being spoken. In a way, this is a bit like being granted access to an almost \u201c<strong>behind-the-scenes</strong>\u201d experience of the story. Take it as a little token of gratitude from the playwright for being one of the people who were <em>curious</em> enough to pick up the original manuscript and <em>determined</em> enough to read it before (or after) the\u00a0show.</p>\n<p><em>My next play, </em><a href=\"https://www.reaver.me/books/hero-of-mistpeak\">The Hero of Mistpeak</a> (Part One)<em> is out next\u00a0month.</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e223fee4ae5a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["theatre","play","playwrights","novel","authors"]},{"title":"The end-of-year State of Play","pubDate":"2023-09-26 11:00:03","link":"https://medium.com/@jameshreaver/the-end-of-the-years-state-of-play-ec46fe2a1a5d?source=rss-74beb466986f------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/ec46fe2a1a5d","author":"James Reaver","thumbnail":"","description":"\n<h4>Quite literally, where are we at with this \u201cplay\u201d?

Only three days into it, my dad sent me a very shouty email: he had found the lost book. What is\u00a0this?</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s roll back 15 years, just like Harry with Tom Riddle\u2019s diary. Back then I was twelve, yet I had already developed a keenness for writing. Many ideas were going through my head at the time, but in the summer of 2008, I was able to finish writing my first book. It was titled \u201c<strong><em>Parenti in Concorso</em></strong>\u201d (Competing Relatives), a children story inspired by the adventures of Geronimo Stilton.

Those were the days before the Internet, ladies and gents. No internet also meant no cloud, and no cloud meant no back-ups. When we threw away our old computer, we lost the file containing the book. There was also only a single printed copy, which I\u2019ve been trying to find for over a decade without\u00a0success.</p>\n<p>You can see why dad was so excited to have found my first book, on his <em>work</em> computer (so much for file retention, eh?).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wpih5LYqCIbkBuKAwNqhdg.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0Yy8y9wa1gSwPzQx4yoN5w.png\"></figure><p>I spent the past few months re-editing and translating the book, which contains all the original artworks, and it is now available in English and Italian on the Amazon online stores of pretty much every country.

With every passing week of home confinement, those stories began ever so intricate until I decided they were better written down. Eighteen months later, roughly at the end of 2021, I had developed a cohesive plot from start to end. This story sees characters from the game, as well as new ones, fight their own battles in an attempt to pursue whatever interests are most dear to their hearts and their morality. And so, \u201c<strong><em>The Hero of Mistpeak</em></strong>\u201d was\u00a0born.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c10WXk5CYt2k5BXfLyFyAg.jpeg\"></figure><p>The play is a tragedy, although it certainly does not lack humorous retorts, and it comprises six acts, each made up of four to six scenes. <strong>Act I</strong> and <strong>Act II</strong> are a story by themselves, which is why I am hoping to publish them as <em>Part One </em>before the end of the year. The drama will then continue with <strong>Act III</strong> and <strong>Act IV</strong> of <em>Part Two </em>and end with <strong>Act V</strong> and <strong>Act VI</strong> of <em>Part\u00a0Three</em>.</p>\n<p>I am incredibly excited about this first step of mine in the world of play writing and I hope that other fans of the series will enjoy it as much as I do.

Social networks are not always simple to handle, especially at times when you face some difficult or debilitating situations in life. I grew up with social networks, but under similar circumstances I pondered how different my life would be if I decided to break out from them for some time. One morning, I\u00a0did.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*j4_1Mdo6eAmmBvOlk-LAqQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>Usually I make a pretty active use of social networks. Twitter, for work and not, Instagram and Facebook. I am not in it for the likes, but it\u2019s nice to maintain an online presence for me, my friends and family. Besides, I\u2019m the kind of person who is very aware of the content I share online\u200a\u2014\u200afrom my holiday in 2012, to the most recent update on LinkedIn. I try to stick to a usage \u201cstyle\u201d for every channel, seeing that each one is slightly different.</p>\n<h4>Social networks by\u00a0content</h4>\n<p>It\u2019s important to say that not all socials can be regarded in the same way. They serve manifold purposes and vary in how they connect users together.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First we have <strong>messaging platforms</strong>. These allow for an active form of communication, where one person has to reach out to you in order to prompt a conversation, and you may reply in your own\u00a0time.</li>\n<li>There are <strong>sharing sites</strong>, which<strong> </strong>can be used to post about your public and personal life, to share your thoughts or otherwise by companies and brands. All this content forms a never-ending feed which proves to be really addictive and to keep users continuously scrolling.</li>\n<li>Similar to the previous one are light <strong>entertainment platforms</strong>, with passive user interaction. TikTok, Facebook Watch and Instagram TV provide short consumable videos with a social and viral side to\u00a0them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On Sunday 23rd February, I hit \u2018disable account\u2019 on all my sharing sites and entertainment platforms, putting a halt to the endless stream of posts they were generating. Instead I kept one messaging platform, seeing that I was fond of the idea of \u2018on-demand\u2019 socialisation, and not deeming it to be a waste of time, especially in a situation of prolonged isolation.</p>\n<h4>How did it go? What\u00a0changed?</h4>\n<p>Sticking to these rules and staying off social media was a true godsend for me. As a Christian, I considered it to be a valuable Lenten sacrifice for reflection and preparation. And over the eight weeks that followed I managed to achieve the following.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Get productive time back</strong>. No screen time or daily reminder feature will let you understand how much time you spend on friends\u2019 feeds and \u20185-minute crafts\u2019 videos until you stop. And even if it\u2019s not time wasted, the content we see affects our mood and can lead to unhealthy habits.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Focus on your goals</strong>. From important life activities, such as finding a new job, to various other projects, the social network hiatus has without doubt made it easy to concentrate on my objectives. Think about it: relaxing time to get what you like done\u200a\u2014\u200ano need to pause it\u00a0forever.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Live the reality you\u2019re in</strong>. Social networks often blur the edges that delimit whom and what is part of our lives. You\u2019re wrong if you assume people will believe you\u2019re not up to anything if you don\u2019t post about it on social media. They will eagerly ask about it the next time you\u00a0meet.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Instead of paying attention to what the people I follow were doing in other parts of the country, I started to serenely enjoy my present, my friends, and every event and moment together. To make memories of it was crucial, to share it online rather needless.</p>\n<h4>Missing out on social\u00a0networks</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aNftMUJCiTsg9H4QoS_BtQ.png\"></figure><p>The biggest question I had was: if I rid myself of my social networks, will I feel disconnected? How lonely would I feel? I can\u2019t stand to be missing\u00a0out.</p>\n<p>These legitimate worries come from our perception of what it means to be connected. We\u2019ve grown to think that the \u201cstream\u201d of posts we draw from is the way to keep in touch and be part of our friends\u2019 lives. But this is not the case. As if inside giant bubble balloons, we see each other but don\u2019t interact.</p>\n<p>These fifty days showed me that these sharing sites offer but an illusion of social contact. They are more superficial and superfluous than we believe. Instead I returned to appreciating close-circle communication and my old-time ability to live with myself. Being able to carry on messaging my friends and family means that I never felt lonely. But there are things that I\u00a0missed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Edifying content</strong>. There is genuinely good content on sites like Twitter. Some of it is enlightening, other simply entertaining: interesting points being made in response to current events, music announcements, new technologies, or the odd tweet there to make you\u00a0laugh.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Facebook events</strong>. No denial here: events on Facebook work really well for people my age to watch what parties are on and what activities your friends are up to. All I did was to ask my pals to keep me in the\u00a0loop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, I was happy to do without fake news, uninformed and aggressive comments, and the infinite stream of posts and short videos from which there was little to gain. Crucially, I also avoided the endless routine of nosy lookups, only because of social media\u2019s ability to secretly do\u00a0so.</p>\n<h4>Control social media with good\u00a0habits</h4>\n<p>Thanks to the great determination I had to get through this online hiatus, I didn\u2019t find it hard to stick to the rules and stay away from social networks. I happily looked forward to dedicating more time to my projects. Only after I completed them and learned new online habits, I felt like it was time to return to my accounts, roughly two months from the beginning.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*otXN2lt0nDpqTGG_xiZ-ug.png\"><figcaption>As if inside giant bubble balloons, we see each other but don\u2019t interact.</figcaption></figure><p>After this brief and personal article, reflect about the impact, if any, that social media has on your life, on how you spend your time, and how you interact with your friends online, but also in reality. Think about the moments you spend alone at home too. If you ever feel overwhelmed, in need of a break, or having to sort things out, then make the decision to take some time off. You might not realise how much you\u2019re affected by them until you do this. It doesn\u2019t have to be forever, and as I said before, it will hardly make you feel disconnected.</p>\n<p>Controlling your social media is like controlling other potentially risky but fun activities in life. Be aware of the negative effects they have on you, especially the types of social sites that are less useful. Writing this article was a social media act. But it\u2019s what I deem to be a good use of\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>I hope you agree that it\u2019s best to spend time in ways that make you grow. And to let as many events as you can reside in the memories of you and those who were present, not in your story archive. You won\u2019t regret\u00a0it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=20f71c19bceb\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h4>Occasionally bursting the social media bubble surrounding us may do wonders for our determination and our quest for real connections, as well as nudging us towards the choice of memories over \u2018stories\u2019.</h4>\n<p>Earlier this year, the ups and downs of life made me think about my use of social media. Social networks are not always simple to handle, especially at times when you face some difficult or debilitating situations in life. I grew up with social networks, but under similar circumstances I pondered how different my life would be if I decided to break out from them for some time. One morning, I\u00a0did.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*j4_1Mdo6eAmmBvOlk-LAqQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>Usually I make a pretty active use of social networks. Twitter, for work and not, Instagram and Facebook. I am not in it for the likes, but it\u2019s nice to maintain an online presence for me, my friends and family. Besides, I\u2019m the kind of person who is very aware of the content I share online\u200a\u2014\u200afrom my holiday in 2012, to the most recent update on LinkedIn. I try to stick to a usage \u201cstyle\u201d for every channel, seeing that each one is slightly different.</p>\n<h4>Social networks by\u00a0content</h4>\n<p>It\u2019s important to say that not all socials can be regarded in the same way. They serve manifold purposes and vary in how they connect users together.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First we have <strong>messaging platforms</strong>. These allow for an active form of communication, where one person has to reach out to you in order to prompt a conversation, and you may reply in your own\u00a0time.</li>\n<li>There are <strong>sharing sites</strong>, which<strong> </strong>can be used to post about your public and personal life, to share your thoughts or otherwise by companies and brands. All this content forms a never-ending feed which proves to be really addictive and to keep users continuously scrolling.</li>\n<li>Similar to the previous one are light <strong>entertainment platforms</strong>, with passive user interaction. TikTok, Facebook Watch and Instagram TV provide short consumable videos with a social and viral side to\u00a0them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On Sunday 23rd February, I hit \u2018disable account\u2019 on all my sharing sites and entertainment platforms, putting a halt to the endless stream of posts they were generating. Instead I kept one messaging platform, seeing that I was fond of the idea of \u2018on-demand\u2019 socialisation, and not deeming it to be a waste of time, especially in a situation of prolonged isolation.</p>\n<h4>How did it go? What\u00a0changed?</h4>\n<p>Sticking to these rules and staying off social media was a true godsend for me. As a Christian, I considered it to be a valuable Lenten sacrifice for reflection and preparation. And over the eight weeks that followed I managed to achieve the following.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Get productive time back</strong>. No screen time or daily reminder feature will let you understand how much time you spend on friends\u2019 feeds and \u20185-minute crafts\u2019 videos until you stop. And even if it\u2019s not time wasted, the content we see affects our mood and can lead to unhealthy habits.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Focus on your goals</strong>. From important life activities, such as finding a new job, to various other projects, the social network hiatus has without doubt made it easy to concentrate on my objectives. Think about it: relaxing time to get what you like done\u200a\u2014\u200ano need to pause it\u00a0forever.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Live the reality you\u2019re in</strong>. Social networks often blur the edges that delimit whom and what is part of our lives. You\u2019re wrong if you assume people will believe you\u2019re not up to anything if you don\u2019t post about it on social media. They will eagerly ask about it the next time you\u00a0meet.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Instead of paying attention to what the people I follow were doing in other parts of the country, I started to serenely enjoy my present, my friends, and every event and moment together. To make memories of it was crucial, to share it online rather needless.</p>\n<h4>Missing out on social\u00a0networks</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aNftMUJCiTsg9H4QoS_BtQ.png\"></figure><p>The biggest question I had was: if I rid myself of my social networks, will I feel disconnected? How lonely would I feel? I can\u2019t stand to be missing\u00a0out.</p>\n<p>These legitimate worries come from our perception of what it means to be connected. We\u2019ve grown to think that the \u201cstream\u201d of posts we draw from is the way to keep in touch and be part of our friends\u2019 lives. But this is not the case. As if inside giant bubble balloons, we see each other but don\u2019t interact.</p>\n<p>These fifty days showed me that these sharing sites offer but an illusion of social contact. They are more superficial and superfluous than we believe. Instead I returned to appreciating close-circle communication and my old-time ability to live with myself. Being able to carry on messaging my friends and family means that I never felt lonely. But there are things that I\u00a0missed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Edifying content</strong>. There is genuinely good content on sites like Twitter. Some of it is enlightening, other simply entertaining: interesting points being made in response to current events, music announcements, new technologies, or the odd tweet there to make you\u00a0laugh.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Facebook events</strong>. No denial here: events on Facebook work really well for people my age to watch what parties are on and what activities your friends are up to. All I did was to ask my pals to keep me in the\u00a0loop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, I was happy to do without fake news, uninformed and aggressive comments, and the infinite stream of posts and short videos from which there was little to gain. Crucially, I also avoided the endless routine of nosy lookups, only because of social media\u2019s ability to secretly do\u00a0so.</p>\n<h4>Control social media with good\u00a0habits</h4>\n<p>Thanks to the great determination I had to get through this online hiatus, I didn\u2019t find it hard to stick to the rules and stay away from social networks. I happily looked forward to dedicating more time to my projects. Only after I completed them and learned new online habits, I felt like it was time to return to my accounts, roughly two months from the beginning.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*otXN2lt0nDpqTGG_xiZ-ug.png\"><figcaption>As if inside giant bubble balloons, we see each other but don\u2019t interact.</figcaption></figure><p>After this brief and personal article, reflect about the impact, if any, that social media has on your life, on how you spend your time, and how you interact with your friends online, but also in reality. Think about the moments you spend alone at home too. If you ever feel overwhelmed, in need of a break, or having to sort things out, then make the decision to take some time off. You might not realise how much you\u2019re affected by them until you do this. It doesn\u2019t have to be forever, and as I said before, it will hardly make you feel disconnected.</p>\n<p>Controlling your social media is like controlling other potentially risky but fun activities in life. Be aware of the negative effects they have on you, especially the types of social sites that are less useful. Writing this article was a social media act. But it\u2019s what I deem to be a good use of\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>I hope you agree that it\u2019s best to spend time in ways that make you grow. And to let as many events as you can reside in the memories of you and those who were present, not in your story archive. You won\u2019t regret\u00a0it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=20f71c19bceb\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["mental-health","social-media","productivity","wellbeing"]}]}
